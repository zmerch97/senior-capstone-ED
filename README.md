# Informatics Senior Capstone

For our senior capstone project, my team and I took on Indiana University’s Emergency Department as a client. 

The requirement of this ongoing project is to develop a web interface to monitor campus-wide safety drills as well as generate feedback reports for further improvements to the University‘s emergency and safety program. 

As an Informatics student, the purpose of the Capstone project has been to demonstrate the application of technical programming and product management skills to a real-world problem. 

Core competencies:
1) Full stack web development with HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and PHP
2) Agile principles
3) Design thinking
4) Product management frameworks
5) Working with APIs
6) Teamwork
7) Documentation
